A text-based game made for Terminal Game Jam.

A savage enemy creeps over the horizon. Bombers snake over an iron sky, casting their Plexiglass eyes upon our dear nation.
You, the player, are our last line of defense. Take command of fighters in GCI: Ground Controlled Intercept, and guide them though cloud and fog
to destroy the fiendish bombers and defend our glourious homeland.
